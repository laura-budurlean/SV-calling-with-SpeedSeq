# SV-calling-with-SpeedSeq
A workflow for using SpeedSeq to align and call SVs from WGS data. A simple guide to SpeedSeq to get SNV, SVs, and to generate normal, discordant, and splitter BAM files. SNV calling with Freebayes, SV calling with LUMPY DELLY is included.

See speedseq_pipeline file for details.
